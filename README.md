https://tsconfig.guide is a simple web app to generate TSConfig files for your new TypeScript project based on a few toggles.

This idea and its contents are heavily influenced by [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock) and his [TSConfig Cheat Sheet](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tsconfig-cheat-sheet). If you haven't checked it out already, I encourage you to view it.
